# codecademy-mixed-messages
## Overview

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Objectives

* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## Background

This JS code is for a Codecademy project in the Full-Stack Engineer career path. The project is part of the Building Interactive Websites section of the course curriculum. I am still learning about licenses, but I gave this project the MIT license so anyone can use it how they would like. (Although I don't expect many people are searching for code like this...)
